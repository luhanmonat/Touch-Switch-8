# Touch-Switch-8

The CAP1298 is a great way to implement 'touch' switches. You don't actually even need to touch them.  They work behind any non-conductive material up to 1/4 inch reliably.

Since the chip is SOIC (surface mount) anyway, I decided to put all the circuitry on one side and the touch pads on the other.  This makes the sensing side totally flat for placing against a sheet of glass or plastic.  You could even use wood for aesthetic reasons.

This device turned out to be rather simple to use initially, but has oodles of registers for tweaking its operation.  You can specify any one of the inputs as a 'power' button - .5 to 2 second delay before it responds.  The touch pads can signal both touch and releases, or just touches.  They can also be made to autorepeat with settable timing.

Wow!  Gotta love the new technology.
